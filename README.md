# Class project 1 | ML Higgs

This is our submission for the first project of "CS-433: Machine Learning" where we designed a classification model.

## The 'scripts' folder

In order to build the best classifier, we used different methods we implemented in the labs to try and have the best performance. All of the files are in the scripts folder.

There is also the "implementation.py" file that contains the graded methods asked by the project description.

The best choice of a model we settled on is written in the script "run.py", that one can simply run by typing in a terminal :

python3 run.py

This will produce a file called "output.csv" that can be uploaded on the competition platform to check the performance.
